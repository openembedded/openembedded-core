# most of the older cm-x270 modules are populated with NAND flash
# that have 128KiB eraseblocks.  Recently, a user encounted
# a device that has 16KiB eraseblocks.  The following define
# can be overridden in local.conf if you have one of these devices.

# package if you change the SERIAL_CONSOLE setting

# to program the compulab NAND flash, the following scheme is suggested.  Create
# a small rootfs that can fit in NOR flash using the following config:
#   - Angstrom distro
#   - uclibc (set ANGSTROM_MODE = "uclibc" in local.conf)
#   - angstrom-minimal-image-with-mtd-utils bitbake target
#   - put the following in your local.conf
#     - IMAGE_FSTYPES = "jffs2 tar cpio.gz"
# now, when you build the image, a cpio.gz will be generated
# that can be used as an initramfs.  You can boot into this image and then
# program the main rootfs jffs2 image in NAND flash using mtd-utils
# you can select booting the initramfs, or the main nand rootfs by using
# the "ramdisk on", or "ramdisk off" commands in the bootloader
