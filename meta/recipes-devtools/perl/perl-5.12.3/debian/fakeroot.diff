Upstream-Status:Inappropriate [debian patch]

Subject: Postpone LD_LIBRARY_PATH evaluation to the binary targets.

Modify the setting of LD_LIBRARY_PATH to append pre-existing values at the
time the rule is evaluated rather than when the Makefile is created.

This is required when building packages with dpkg-buildpackage and fakeroot,
since fakeroot (which now sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH) is not used for the "build"
rule where the Makefile is created, but is for the clean/binary* targets.
