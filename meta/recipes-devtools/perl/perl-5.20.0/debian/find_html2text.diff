Subject: Configure CPAN::Distribution with correct name of html2text

Bug-Debian: http://bugs.debian.org/640479
Patch-Name: debian/find_html2text.diff

If you use cpan from Debian you usually wind up trying to read online
documentation through it. Unfortunately cpan can't find the
html2text.pl script even though it is installed using the Debian
package 'html2text'.

Please see the attached patch for a quick fix of this issue.

[Maintainer's note: html2text in Debian is not the same implementation
as the html2text.pl which is expected, but should provide similar
functionality].
