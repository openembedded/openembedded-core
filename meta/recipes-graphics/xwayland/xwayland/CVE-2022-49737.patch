Subject: [PATCH] dix: Hold input lock for AttachDevice()

Fix the following race:

 Block was alloc'd by thread #1

The steps to trigger the race are:
1. Main thread does cleanup at mipointer.c:360 setting the slave device's
   miPointerPtr to null.
2. Input thread use MIPOINTER in mipointer.c and get the slave's
   miPointerPtr = null.
3. Main thread updates dev->master at devices.c:2609.
4. MIPOINTER would now return the master's miPointerPtr but the input
   thread already got the slave's miPointerPtr in step 2 and segfaults by
   null ptr deref.
