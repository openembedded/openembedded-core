Compiling conformance test leads running test-conformance target binary, and
gets failure in cross-compile environment. Introduce this commit from upstream
to fix it.

    tests: Generate the stub scripts using sed
    
    Instead of trying to run ./test-conformance with the -l option to
    generate a list of available tests it now runs sed on the
    test-conform-main.c file instead. Running the generated executable is
    a pain for cross-compiling so it would be nice to avoid it unless it's
    absolutely necessary. Although you could tell people who are cross
    compiling to just disable the conformance tests, this seems a shame
    because they could still be useful along with the wrappers for example
    if the cross compile is built to a shared network folder where the
    tests can be run on the actual device.
    
    The sed script is a little more ugly than it could be because it tries
    to avoid using the GNU extensions '\+' and '\|'.
    
    The script ends up placing restrictions on the format of the C file
    because the tests must all be listed on one line each. There is now a
    comment to explain this. Hopefully the trade off is worth it.
