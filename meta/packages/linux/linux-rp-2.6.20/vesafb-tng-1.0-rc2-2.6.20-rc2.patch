 What is vesafb?
 ===============
 
-This is a generic driver for a graphic framebuffer on intel boxes.
+Vesafb is a generic framebuffer driver for x86 and x86_64 boxes.
 
-The idea is simple:  Turn on graphics mode at boot time with the help
-of the BIOS, and use this as framebuffer device /dev/fb0, like the m68k
-(and other) ports do.
+VESA BIOS Extensions Version 2.0 are required, because we need access to
+a linear frame buffer. VBE 3.0 is required if you want to use modes with a
+higher (than the standard 60 Hz) refresh rate.
 
-This means we decide at boot time whenever we want to run in text or
-graphics mode.  Switching mode later on (in protected mode) is
-impossible; BIOS calls work in real mode only.  VESA BIOS Extensions
-Version 2.0 are required, because we need a linear frame buffer.
+The VESA framebuffer driver comes in two flavors - the standard 'vesafb'
+and 'vesafb-tng'. Vesafb-tng is available only on 32-bit x86 due to the
+technology it uses (vm86). Vesafb-tng has more features than vesafb
+(adjusting the refresh rate on VBE 3.0 compliant boards, switching the
+video mode without rebooting, selecting a mode by providing its
+modedb name, and more).

 How to use it?
 ==============
 
-Switching modes is done using the vga=... boot parameter.  Read
-Documentation/svga.txt for details.
+If you are running a 32-bit x86 system and you decide to use vesafb-tng,
+you can either compile the driver into the kernel or use it as a module.
+The graphics mode you want to use is in both cases specified using the
+standard modedb format.
 
-You should compile in both vgacon (for text mode) and vesafb (for
-graphics mode). Which of them takes over the console depends on
-whenever the specified mode is text or graphics.
+If your system doesn't support vm86 calls, things get a little more tricky.
+Since on such systems you can't do BIOS calls from protected mode in which
+kernel runs, you have to decide at boot time whenever you want to run in text
+or in graphics mode. Switching mode later on is impossible. Switching modes
+is done using the vga=... boot parameter.  Read Documentation/svga.txt for
+details. Below is a more detailed description of what to do on systems using
+the standard vesafb driver.
 
-The graphic modes are NOT in the list which you get if you boot with
-vga=ask and hit return. The mode you wish to use is derived from the
-VESA mode number. Here are those VESA mode numbers:

 Configuration
 =============
 
-The VESA BIOS provides protected mode interface for changing
-some parameters.  vesafb can use it for palette changes and
-to pan the display.  It is turned off by default because it
-seems not to work with some BIOS versions, but there are options
-to turn it on.
-
-You can pass options to vesafb using "video=vesafb:option" on
-the kernel command line.  Multiple options should be separated
-by comma, like this: "video=vesafb:ypan,invers"
-
-Accepted options:
-
-invers	no comment...
-
-ypan	enable display panning using the VESA protected mode 
-	interface.  The visible screen is just a window of the
-	video memory, console scrolling is done by changing the
-	start of the window.
-	pro:	* scrolling (fullscreen) is fast, because there is
-		  no need to copy around data.
-		* You'll get scrollback (the Shift-PgUp thing),
-		  the video memory can be used as scrollback buffer
-	kontra: * scrolling only parts of the screen causes some
-		  ugly flicker effects (boot logo flickers for
-		  example).
-
-ywrap	Same as ypan, but assumes your gfx board can wrap-around 
-	the video memory (i.e. starts reading from top if it
-	reaches the end of video memory).  Faster than ypan.
-
-redraw	scroll by redrawing the affected part of the screen, this
-	is the safe (and slow) default.
-
-
-vgapal	Use the standard vga registers for palette changes.
-	This is the default.
-pmipal	Use the protected mode interface for palette changes.
-
-mtrr:n	setup memory type range registers for the vesafb framebuffer

+Options accepted only by vesafb-tng:
+
+<mode>  The mode you want to set, in the standard modedb format. Refer to
+        modedb.txt for a detailed description. If you specify a mode that is
+        not supported by your board's BIOS, vesafb-tng will attempt to set a
+        similar mode. The list of supported modes can be found in
+        /proc/fbx/modes, where x is the framebuffer number (usually 0).
+        When vesafb-tng is compiled as a module, the mode string should be
+        provided as a value of the parameter 'mode'.
+
+vbemode:x
+        Force the use of VBE mode x. The mode will only be set if it's
+        found in the VBE-provided list of supported modes.
+        NOTE: The mode number 'x' should be specified in VESA mode number
+        notation, not the Linux kernel one (eg. 257 instead of 769).
+        HINT: If you use this option because normal <mode> parameter does
+        not work for you and you use a X server, you'll probably want to
+        set the 'nocrtc' option to ensure that the video mode is properly
+        restored after console <-> X switches.
+
+nocrtc  Do not use CRTC timings while setting the video mode. This option
+        makes sence only with VBE 3.0 compliant systems. Use it if you have
+        problems with modes set in the standard way. Note that using this
+		option means that any refresh rate adjustments will be ignored
+		and the refresh rate will stay at your BIOS default (60 Hz).
+
+noedid  Do not try to fetch and use EDID-provided modes.
+
+noblank Disable hardware blanking.
+
+gtf     Force the use of VESA's GTF (Generalized Timing Formula). Specifying
+        this will cause vesafb to skip its internal modedb and EDID-modedb
+        and jump straight to the GTF part of the code (normally used only if
+        everything else failed). This can be useful if you want to get as
+        much as possible from your graphics board but your BIOS doesn't
+        support modes with the refresh rates you require. Note that you may 
+		need to specify the maxhf, maxvf and maxclk parameters if they are not
+        provided by the EDID block.
+
+Additionally, the following parameters may be provided. They all override the
+EDID-provided values and BIOS defaults. Refer to your monitor's specs to get
+the correct values for maxhf, maxvf and maxclk for your hardware.
+
+maxhf:n     Maximum horizontal frequency (in kHz).
+maxvf:n     Maximum vertical frequency (in Hz).
+maxclk:n    Maximum pixel clock (in MHz).
