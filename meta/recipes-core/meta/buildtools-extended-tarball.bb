DESCRIPTION = "SDK type target for building a standalone tarball containing build-essentials, python3, chrpath, \
               make, git and tar. The tarball can be used to run bitbake builds on systems which don't meet the \
               usual version requirements and have ancient compilers."
SUMMARY = "Standalone tarball for running builds on systems with inadequate software and ancient compilers"
