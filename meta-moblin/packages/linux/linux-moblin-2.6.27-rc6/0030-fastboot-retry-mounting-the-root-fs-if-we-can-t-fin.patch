Subject: [PATCH] fastboot: retry mounting the root fs if we can't find init

currently we wait until all device init is done before trying to mount
the root fs, and to consequently execute init.

In preparation for relaxing the first delay, this patch adds a retry
attempt in case /sbin/init is not found. Before retrying, the code
will wait for all device init to complete.

While this patch by itself doesn't gain boot time yet (it needs follow on
patches), the alternative already is to panic()...
