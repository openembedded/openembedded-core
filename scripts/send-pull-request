Usage: $(basename $0) [-h] [-a] [[-t email]...] -p pull-dir 
  -t email     Explicitly add email to the recipients
  -a           Automatically harvest recipients from "*-by: email" lines
               in the patches in the pull-dir
  -f           Specify a FROM address, you can also use the FROM environment
               variable. If you do not specify one, it will try to use the one
               from your git config. This is ignored if -g is used.
  -g           Use git-send-email to send mail instead of sendmail
  -p pull-dir  Directory containing summary and patch files
