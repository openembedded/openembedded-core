#
# Poky-tiny is intended to define a tiny Linux system comprised of a
# Linux kernel tailored to support each specific MACHINE and busybox.
# Poky-tiny sets some basic policy to ensure a usable system while still
# keeping the rootfs and kernel image as small as possible.
#
# The policies defined are intended to meet the following goals:
# o Serial consoles only (no framebuffer or VGA console)
# o Basic support for IPV4 networking
# o Single user ash shell
# o Static images (no support for adding packages or libraries later)
# o Read-only or RAMFS root filesystem
# o Combined Linux kernel + rootfs in under 4MB
# o Allow the user to select between eglibc or uclibc with the TCLIBC variable
#
# This is currently a partial definition, the following tasks remain:
# [ ] Integrate linux-yocto-tiny ktype into linux-yocto
# [ ] Define linux-yocto-tiny configs for all supported BSPs
# [ ] Drop ldconfig from the installation
# [ ] Modify the runqemu scripts to work with ext2 parameter:
#     runqemu qemux86 qemuparams="-nographic" bootparams="console=ttyS0,115200 root=0800" 
# [ ] Modify busybox to allow for DISTRO_FEATURES-like confiruration
