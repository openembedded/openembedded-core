This patch overrides the root-home.patch for DISTRO=openslug

The patch sets a root password on /etc/passwd, this password is

opeNSLUg

This allows ssh (dropbear) login to an OpenSlug NSLU2 using that
password.

The password is NO MORE SECURE than the previous empty string,
however, because ssh logins can now succeed the NSLU2 is LESS
secure!  This password must be changed as soon as possible after
initial configuration of the NSLU2.
